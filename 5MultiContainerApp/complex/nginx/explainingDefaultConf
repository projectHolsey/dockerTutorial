It creates 2 different ports for upstream communication.

Anything for the client goes to port 3000
anything for the api goes to port 5000
-- You can see the api and client definitions inside the docker-compose file

Line 9 is creating the nginx server
It listens on port 80
Any request that's sent via the default '/' is sent to the client
Any request that's sent via the '/api' is sent to the api

-> Note - Line 17 just rewrites the request to got remove the '/api' part when it's sent to the api webserver
