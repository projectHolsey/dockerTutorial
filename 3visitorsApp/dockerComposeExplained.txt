Docker compose is a separate cli that gets install with docker

It's used to start multiple containers at the same time

Automates some of the long-winded arguments we were passing to docker run 
( e.g. docker run -p 8080:8080 projectholsey/visit )


docker compose has to be run inside a directory containing the docker-compose.yml.
If you're not in said dir, it'll complain.

===================================
docker-compose up
> Looks into current dir to find docker compose yml file

docker-compose up --build
> If we want to rebuild the image inside the docker compose file

docker-compose down
> if we want to stop all the docker containers in this docker-compuse group



===================================
restarting a container when / if the program servers

( can see in docker ps, that there may be a container that's crashed as it'll be absent from output )

Restart policy
[ no | always | on-failure | unless-stopped ]

note - if the docker container is restarted automatically due to a crash,
	it uses the last container, it doesn't start a new one.
	Also appends to the crashed container's logs.

"no" - don't restart, but also, if using this option, then we specifically need to
	type the word "no" with quotes. (as no === false in yml)

always - Always restart regradless of the exit reason
	>> good for web apps where you always want them active

On-failure - Will only restart the container if the running process exited with
	an exit code of anything other than 0.
	Exiting with 0 is GOOD, exiting with anything beyond that is BAD.
	>> good for a temporary service / worker process that runs and exists


unless-stopped - always restart unless I forcibly tell it to start.
