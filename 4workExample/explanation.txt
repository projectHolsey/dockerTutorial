This segment is designed to walk through how to develop, test and deploy with docker.

It'll also go through how we re-develop, re-test and re-deploy for a development lifecycle

Example flow.

> You push code to github feature branch in a repo.
> You then make a pull request against the main branch
> a montioring service will take this code in master / main branch and run 
	all the tests you designed for it.
	For the sake of this demo, it'll be using travis ci
> Once it's fully passed all those tests, it'll auto push this to AWS host

=====================================

NOTE - docker isn't needed for these workflows. It is a tool to make
	executing some of these tasks so much easier

=====================================

This'll use a react app.
