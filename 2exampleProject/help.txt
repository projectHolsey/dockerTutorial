Notes from Section 4:

== 

Not all base images will come with what you want, so you can look up an image that
does on : "hub.docker.com".

On this website you can look for base image you want.
It'll tell you in the description what tags there are that come with node.

Some will come with a BUNCH of other installed programs to (e.g. GIT)

==

By default, no traffic is routed in the container(s)
They essentially have their own isolated set of ports 

You have to port map to forward request on your local network to the 
container

( only talks about INCOMING requests. Containers can already speak to outside world )

Docker port forwarding is done strictly in the run command, not the docker build file

docker run -p 8080:8080 projectholsey/simpleweb

<The port to forward from on your machine TO on the container>

==

You don't have to rebuild all the time if you make a refresh.

If you change a file and re-build, you need to re-make the entire system
from the line where you copied the changed file onwards
